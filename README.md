Supplemental Material for a review on evaluating SNP calling pipelines
=======================

This repository contains three primary documents and the raw data used to generate the tables and figures in the doucments

1.  snp_demo_data.v2 and snp_eval_pub_figures: These are the code using to convert the input vcf files into a csv file that is used to generate Figures 4-6 in the publication.  The figures demonstrate how to compare performance metrics for multiple pipelines.  The raw data used to generate the figures is in the demo_vcf directory.
2.  sra_summary.Rmd: A R markdown document used to generate the summary table to seqeunce datasets that can be used for evaluate variant calling pipelines.  The raw data used to generate the table is in the sra_list directory.
